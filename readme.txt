That project illustrates how the [kisser] library works.

In order to build the project the task data.test.app must be run.
The programme loads and constructs the object tree from the resource sets all declared props and calls all
registered notifications.
The output files are collected in directory build\app\
use bat.bat to run.

Build and see for yourself.
